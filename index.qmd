Here's a simple plot using built-in R data:

```{r}
#| label: scatter-plot
#| fig-cap: "MPG vs. Weight for Different Car Types"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Car Weight vs. MPG",
       x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
       y = "Miles per Gallon",
       color = "Cylinders") +
  theme_minimal()
```
